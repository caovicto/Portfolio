description: I am currently researching decision making within various mental models using genetic programming within the Digital Evolution Lab at Michigan State University under <a href="https://ofria.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Ofria</a> and graduate student <a href="https://cliffbohm.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Clifford Bohm</a> funded by the Honors College Research Scholars Program. Last year, I focused on examining different computing models, such as Cartesian Genetic Programming, Markov Brain, and Artificial Neural Networks, to examine the fitness behavior within tests created within the software MABE- Modular Agent Based Evolver. My experiment created a simplified experiment with a virtual autonomous “vehicle” to examine the behavior and learning patterns of Artificial Neural Networks through additional feedback questions pertaining to relevant objects within my world. <br><br> Over this past summer I was able to join the WAVES research program, where I researched genome frameworks for optimized memory usage, and created a structure that optimizes shift mutation on 75kb and larger genomes for MABE2 development. My blog post can be read on the <a href="http://mmore500.com/waves/blog/Victoria-Cao.html" target="_blank">WAVES workshop website</a>.
