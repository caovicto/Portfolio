description: During the summer of 2019, I was a part of the Advances Computational Research Experience for Undergraduates at Michigan State University, working with the Multi-Institutional Open Storage Research Infrastructure’s branch at Michigan State University funded by the National Science Foundation. <br><br> Throughout the course of the summer my research project was to create a program to automate metadata collection, efficiently query data, and customize data storage hierarchies. This was done by integrating OSIRIS’s Amazon S3-compatible services with an iRODS (Integrated Rule-Orientated Data System) middle-ware server, and making these resources available to MSU’s high performance computing center. This project was in preparation to deploy this resource between MSU and the van Andel Institute to facilitate gene data transfer between the two locations. At the end of the program, my colleague and I presented a poster at the Mid-Michigan Symposium for Undergraduate Research.
