## About The Series

**Aspiring witch Violet Amaryllis aims to reform the corrupt Hero Industry, and attending academy Calia Nova seems like the perfect way to do it!**
However, not all is as it seems; she’s soon swept up in politics and rivalries she can’t begin to understand. As she inherits her predecessor’s mistakes, powerful enemies threaten both her life and ideals, and Violet realizes she knows nothing. It’s too late now, though; the galaxy is counting on her, and her lifelong dream might just be a nightmare…

Calia Nova is written and illustrated by Olivia Barone.
